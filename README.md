## 🔍 How WU-Killer Works

WU-Killer stops specific Windows services and system tasks that control updates:

- Disables the **Windows Update Service** (wuauserv)
- Stops the **Background Intelligent Transfer Service** (BITS)
- Suspends scheduled update tasks
- Changes system settings related to automatic updates

This prevents Windows from checking for, downloading, or installing updates automatically. The tool works quickly and silently without needing additional software.

## 🧰 Troubleshooting Tips

If you have issues, try these steps:

- **Run as administrator:** Right-click on the app and select "Run as administrator."
- **Restart your PC:** Sometimes this helps apply the changes.
- **Check for error messages:** If the app shows an error, note the message and try again.
- **Antivirus interference:** Some antivirus programs might block changes to system services. Temporarily disable your antivirus or add an exception, then try again.
- **Windows versions:** WU-Killer works best on modern versions of Windows, but some older editions may behave differently.

If WU-Killer does not seem to disable updates, your system may have additional update management tools installed. Check your Windows Update settings manually as well.

## 🔄 Re-enabling Windows Update

To re-enable updates:

1. Open WU-Killer.
2. Click **Enable Windows Update**.
3. Wait for the confirmation.
4. Restart your PC.
5. Verify updates by going to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update.

If you face issues, you can use Windows' built-in "Troubleshoot" feature to fix Windows Update problems.
